# Physics Informed Learning

Although there are heaps of files in this repo, most of the files are just experimental. There are three main priority files (outlined below).
Additionally, there are two optional files that explain a bit more about the car problem. The rest are not of concern.

## Priority Files

 - **Car optimisation**: 
 
The full car problem solved using Finite difference and used to generate 6% reduction in fuel spend

 - **2 tanks - Nonlinear with MPC**:

Simpler SAG mill analogy system

 - **ADCME/adcme_workingdirectoy/tank_nl_speed_lk/twotanks_nl_speed_k_pcl_backward_crank_y.jl**:

Full solution of the two tanks problem using ADMCE

 - **ADCME/adcme_workingdirectoy/tank_nl_speed_lk/results/y**: 

Results of the above

## Optional:

 - MPC - temperature variation: The Car problem outlined and data generated
 - Finite Difference method 3 with NN - Temperature Variation: The general finite difference method used to solve the car problem
